# Nested class = A class defined within another class
#                class Outer:
#                   class Inner:

# Benefits: Allows you logically group classes that are closely related
#           Encapsulates private details that aren`t relevent outside of the outer class
#           Keeps the namespace clean; reduces the possibility of naming conflicts
